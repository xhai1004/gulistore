This allows for more flexibility when the tags need to be altered by other plugins.\n\n- `include` option can be an object in the shape of `{ type?, chunks?, entries? }`. For example, to prefetch async chunks for a specific entry point:\n\n  ``` js\n  {\n    rel: 'prefetch',\n    include: {\n      type: 'asyncChunks',\n      entries: ['app']\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Added an `includeHtmlNames` option so that the plugin is only applied to a specific HTML file.\n\n- Drops support for webpack v3.\n\n- Drops support for Node < 6.\n\n---\n\n![preloads-plugin-compressor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/110953/22451103/7700b812-e720-11e6-89e8-a6d4e3533159.png)\n\nA Webpack plugin for automatically wiring up asynchronous (and other types) of JavaScript\nchunks using `<link rel='preload'>`. This helps with lazy-loading.\n\nNote: This is an extension plugin for [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) - a plugin that\nsimplifies the creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles.\n\nThis plugin is a stop-gap until we add support for asynchronous chunk wiring to\n[script-ext-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/numical/script-ext-html-webpack-plugin/pull/9).\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n[Preload](https://w3c.github.io/preload/) is a web standard aimed at improving performance\nand granular loading of resources. It is a declarative fetch that can tell a browser to start fetching a\nsource because a developer knows the resource will be needed soon. [Preload: What is it good for?](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/preload-what-is-it-good-for/)\nis a recommended read if you haven't used the feature before.\n\nIn simple web apps, it's straight-forward to specify static paths to scripts you\nwould like to preload - especially if their names or locations are unlikely to change. In more complex apps,\nJavaScript can be split into \"chunks\" (that represent routes or components) at with dynamic\nnames. These names can include hashes, numbers and other properties that can change with each build.\n\nFor example, `chunk.31132ae6680e598f8879.js`.\n\nTo make it easier to wire up async chunks for lazy-loading, this plugin offers a drop-in way to wire them up\nusing `<link rel='preload'>`.\n\nPre-requisites\n--------------\nThis module requires Webpack 2.2.0 and above. It also requires that you're using\n[html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) in your Webpack project.\n\nInstallation\n---------------\n\nFirst, install the package as a dependency in your package.json:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save-dev preload-webpack-plugin\n```\n\nAlternatively, using yarn:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D preload-webpack-plugin\n```\n\nUsage\n-----------------\n\nNext, in your Webpack config, `require()` the preload plugin as follows:\n\n```js\nconst PreloadWebpackPlugin = require('preload-webpack-plugin');\n```\n\nand finally, configure the plugin in your Webpack `plugins` array after `HtmlWebpackPlugin`:\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new PreloadWebpackPlugin()\n]\n```\n\nWhen preloading files, the plugin will use different `as` attribute depends on the type of each\nfile. For each file ends with `.css`, the plugin will preload it with `as=style`, for each file ends\nwith `.woff2`, the plugin will preload it with `as=font`, while for all other files, `as=script`\nwill be used.\n\nIf you do not prefer to determine `as` attribute depends on suffix of filename, you can also\nexplicitly name it using `as`:\n\n```javascript\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n    rel: 'preload',\n    as: 'script'\n  })\n]\n```\n\nIn case you need more fine-grained control of the `as` atribute, you could also provide a function here.\nWhen using it, entry name will be provided as the parameter, and function itself should return a\nstring for `as` attribute:\n\n```javascript\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n    rel: 'preload',\n    as(entry) {\n      if (/\\.css$/.test(entry)) return 'style';\n      if (/\\.woff$/.test(entry)) return 'font';\n      if (/\\.png$/.test(entry)) return 'image';\n      return 'script';\n    }\n  })\n]\n```\n\nNotice that if `as=font` is used in preload, crossorigin will be added, otherwise the font resource\nmight be double fetched. Explains can be found in [this article](https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf).\n\nBy default, the plugin will assume async script chunks will be preloaded. This is the equivalent of:\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n    rel: 'preload',\n    include: 'asyncChunks'\n  })\n]\n```\n\nFor a project generating two async scripts with dynamically generated names, such as\n`chunk.31132ae6680e598f8879.js` and `chunk.d15e7fdfc91b34bb78c4.js`, the following preloads\nwill be injected into the document `<head>`:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"script\" href=\"chunk.31132ae6680e598f8879.js\">\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"script\" href=\"chunk.d15e7fdfc91b34bb78c4.js\">\n```\n\nYou can also configure the plugin to preload all chunks (vendor, async, normal chunks) using `include: 'all'`, or only preload initial chunks with `include: 'initial'`:\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n    rel: 'preload',\n    include: 'all' // or 'initial'\n  })\n]\n```\n\nIn case you work with named chunks, you can explicitly specify which ones to `include` by passing an array:\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n    rel: 'preload',\n    include: ['home']\n  })\n]\n```\n\nwill inject just this:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"script\" href=\"home.31132ae6680e598f8879.js\">\n```\n\nFiltering chunks\n---------------------\n\nThere may be chunks that you don't want to have preloaded (sourcemaps, for example). Before preloading each chunk, this plugin checks that the file does not match any regex in the `fileBlacklist` option. The default value of this blacklist is `[/\\.map/]`, meaning no sourcemaps will be preloaded. You can easily override this:\n\n```js\nnew PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n  fileBlacklist: [/\\.whatever/]\n})\n```\n\nPassing your own array will override the default, so if you want to continue filtering sourcemaps along with your own custom settings, you'll need to include the regex for sourcemaps:\n\n```js\nnew PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n  fileBlacklist: [/\\.map/, /\\.whatever/]\n})\n```\n\nResource Hints\n---------------------\n\nShould you wish to use Resource Hints (such as `prefetch`) instead of `preload`, this plugin also supports wiring those up.\n\nPrefetch:\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new PreloadWebpackPlugin({\n    rel: 'prefetch'\n  })\n]\n```\n\nFor the async chunks mentioned earlier, the plugin would update your HTML to the following:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"chunk.31132ae6680e598f8879.js\">\n<link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"chunk.d15e7fdfc91b34bb78c4.js\">\n```\n\nDemo\n----------------------\n\nA demo application implementing the [PRPL pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) with React that uses this plugin can be found in the `demo`\ndirectory.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you've found an error in this sample, please file an issue:\n[https://github.com/googlechrome/preload-webpack-plugin/issues](https://github.com/googlechrome/preload-webpack-plugin/issues)\n\nPatches are encouraged, and may be submitted by forking this project and\nsubmitting a pull request through GitHub.\n\nContributing workflow\n---------------------\n\n`index.js` contains the primary source for the plugin, `test` contains tests and `demo` contains demo code.\n\nTest the plugin:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n$ npm run test\n```\n\nLint the plugin:\n\n```sh\n$ npm run lint\n$ npm run lint-fix # fix linting issues\n```\n\nThe project is written in ES2015, but does not use a build-step. This may change depending on\nany Node version support requests posted to the issue tracker.\n\nAdditional Notes\n---------------------------\n\n* Be careful not to `preload` resources a user is unlikely to need. This can waste their bandwidth.\n* Use `preload` for the current session if you think a user is likely to visit the next page. There is no\n  100% guarantee preloaded items will end up in the HTTP Cache and read locally beyond this session.\n* If optimising for future sessions, use `prefetch` and `preconnect`. Prefetched resources are maintained\n  in the HTTP Cache for at least 5 minutes (in Chrome) regardless of the resource's cachability.\n\nRelated plugins\n--------------------------\n\n* [script-ext-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/numical/script-ext-html-webpack-plugin) - Enhances html-webpack-plugin with options including 'async', 'defer', 'module' and preload (no async chunk support yet)\n* [resource-hints-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/resource-hints-webpack-plugin) - Automatically wires resource hints for your resources (similarly no async chunk support)\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2017 Google, Inc.\n\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor\nlicense agreements.
