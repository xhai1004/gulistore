By default, when a string is passed this library will split the string on `.` or a [custom separator](#options-separator) It's useful to pass an array\n\n### Escaping\n\n**Escaping with backslashes**\n\nPrevent set-value from splitting on a dot by prefixing it with backslashes:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(set({}, 'a\\\\.b.c', 'd'));\n//=> { 'a.b': { c: 'd' } }\n\nconsole.log(set({}, 'a\\\\.b\\\\.c', 'd'));\n//=> { 'a.b.c': 'd' }\n```\n\n## Options\n\n### options.preservePaths\n\nDo not split properties that include a `/`. By default, set-value assumes that properties with a `/` are not intended to be split. This option allows you to disable default behavior.\n\nNote that this option cannot be used if `options.separator` is set to `/`.\n\n**Type**: `boolean`\n\n**Default**: `true`\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nconsole.log(set({}, 'https://github.com', true));\n//=> { 'https://github.com': true }\n\nconsole.log(set({}, 'https://github.com', true, { preservePaths: false }));\n//=> { 'https://github': { com: true } }\n```\n\n### options.separator\n\nCustom separator to use for splitting object paths.\n\n**Type**: `string`\n\n**Default**: `.`\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nconsole.log(set(obj, 'auth/userpass/users/bob', '*****', { separator: '/' }));\n//=> { auth: { userpass: { users: { bob: '*****' } } } }\n```\n\n### options.split\n\nCustom `.split()` function to use.\n\n### options.merge\n\nAllows you to update plain object values, instead of overwriting them.\n\n**Type**: `boolean|function` - A custom `merge` function may be defined if you need to deep merge. Otherwise, when `merge` is `true`, a shallow merge will be performed by `Object.assign()`.\n\n**Default**: `undefined`\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nconst obj = { foo: { bar: { baz: 'qux' } } };\nset(obj, 'foo.bar.fez', 'zzz', { merge: true });\n//=> { foo: { bar: { baz: 'qux', fez: 'zzz' } } }\n```\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nBenchmarks were run on a MacBook Pro 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3.\n\n```\n# deep (194 bytes)\n  deep-object x 823,287 ops/sec ±1.00% (90 runs sampled)\n  deep-property x 1,787,990 ops/sec ±0.82% (92 runs sampled)\n  deephas x 840,700 ops/sec ±0.95% (93 runs sampled)\n  dot-prop x 1,249,663 ops/sec ±0.89% (90 runs sampled)\n  dot2val x 2,067,212 ops/sec ±1.08% (91 runs sampled)\n  es5-dot-prop x 1,668,806 ops/sec ±0.92% (92 runs sampled)\n  lodash-set x 1,286,725 ops/sec ±0.82% (90 runs sampled)\n  object-path-set x 1,261,242 ops/sec ±1.63% (90 runs sampled)\n  object-set x 285,369 ops/sec ±0.91% (90 runs sampled)\n  set-value x 2,076,931 ops/sec ±0.86% (93 runs sampled)\n\n  fastest is set-value, dot2val (by 203% avg)\n\n# medium (98 bytes)\n  deep-object x 5,811,161 ops/sec ±1.12% (90 runs sampled)\n  deep-property x 4,075,885 ops/sec ±0.91% (90 runs sampled)\n  deephas x 1,508,136 ops/sec ±0.82% (92 runs sampled)\n  dot-prop x 2,809,838 ops/sec ±1.16% (87 runs sampled)\n  dot2val x 4,600,890 ops/sec ±0.76% (91 runs sampled)\n  es5-dot-prop x 3,263,790 ops/sec ±0.97% (91 runs sampled)\n  lodash-set x 3,486,628 ops/sec ±1.20% (90 runs sampled)\n  object-path-set x 3,729,018 ops/sec ±0.90% (92 runs sampled)\n  object-set x 973,961 ops/sec ±0.80% (92 runs sampled)\n  set-value x 6,941,474 ops/sec ±1.24% (90 runs sampled)\n\n  fastest is set-value (by 206% avg)\n\n# shallow (101 bytes)\n  deep-object x 9,416,410 ops/sec ±1.19% (89 runs sampled)\n  deep-property x 5,108,536 ops/sec ±0.98% (93 runs sampled)\n  deephas x 1,706,979 ops/sec ±0.98% (86 runs sampled)\n  dot-prop x 4,045,902 ops/sec ±1.10% (92 runs sampled)\n  dot2val x 5,862,418 ops/sec ±0.88% (91 runs sampled)\n  es5-dot-prop x 4,439,646 ops/sec ±1.18% (90 runs sampled)\n  lodash-set x 9,303,292 ops/sec ±1.19% (89 runs sampled)\n  object-path-set x 5,657,479 ops/sec ±0.95% (93 runs sampled)\n  object-set x 2,020,041 ops/sec ±0.92% (91 runs sampled)\n  set-value x 11,272,227 ops/sec ±1.36% (88 runs sampled)\n\n  fastest is set-value (by 213% avg)\n\n```\n\n### Running the benchmarks\n\nClone this library into a local directory:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/jonschlinkert/set-value.git\n```\n\nThen install devDependencies and run benchmarks:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install && node benchmark\n```\n\n## Comparisons to other libs, or _\"the list of shame\"_\n\nThese are just a few of the duplicate libraries on NPM.\n\n* [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury) fails all of the tests. I even wrapped it to have it return the object instead of the value, but with all of that work it still fails the vast majority of tests.\n* [deep-get-set](https://github.com/acstll/deep-get-set) fails 22 of 26 unit tests.\n* [deep-object](https://github.com/ayushgp/deep-object) fails 25 of 26 unit tests, completely butchered given objects.\n* [deep-property](https://github.com/mikattack/node-deep-property) fails 17 of 26 unit tests.\n* [deep-set](https://github.com/klaemo/deep-set) fails 13 of 26 unit tests.\n* [deephas](https://github.com/sharpred/deepHas) fails 17 of 26 unit tests.\n* [dot-prop](https://github.com/sindresorhus/dot-prop) fails 9 of 26 unit tests.\n* [dot2val](https://github.com/yangg/dot2val) fails 17 of 26 unit tests.\n* [es5-dot-prop](https://github.com/sindresorhus/dot-prop) fails 15 of 26 unit tests.\n* [getsetdeep](https://github.com/bevry/getsetdeep) fails all unit tests due to `this` being used improperly in the methods. I was able to patch it by binding the (plain) object to the methods, but it still fails 17 of 26 unit tests.\n* [lodash.set](https://lodash.com/) fails 11 of 26 unit tests.\n* [object-path-set](https://github.com/skratchdot/object-path-set) fails 12 of 26 unit tests.\n* [object-path](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path) fails 16 of 26 unit tests.\n* [object-set](https://github.com/gearcase/object-set) fails 13 of 26 unit tests.\n* [set-nested-prop](https://github.com/tiaanduplessis/set-nested-prop) fails 24 of 26 unit tests.\n* [setvalue](https://github.com/blakeembrey/setvalue) (this library is almost identical to a previous version of this library)\n* Many dozens of others\n\n**Others that do the same thing, but use a completely different API**\n\n* [deep-set-in](https://github.com/KulikovskyIgor/deep-set-in)\n* [set-deep](https://github.com/radubrehar/set-deep)\n* [set-deep-prop](https://github.com/mmckelvy/set-deep-prop)\n* [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury)\n* Many dozens of others\n\n## History\n\n### v3.0.0\n\n* Added support for a custom `split` function to be passed on the options.\n* Removed support for splitting on brackets, since a [custom function](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/split-string) can be passed to do this now.\n\n### v2.0.0\n\n* Adds support for escaping with double or single quotes. See [escaping](#escaping) for examples.\n* Will no longer split inside brackets or braces. See [bracket support](#bracket-support) for examples.\n\nIf there are any regressions please create a [bug report](../../issues/new).
