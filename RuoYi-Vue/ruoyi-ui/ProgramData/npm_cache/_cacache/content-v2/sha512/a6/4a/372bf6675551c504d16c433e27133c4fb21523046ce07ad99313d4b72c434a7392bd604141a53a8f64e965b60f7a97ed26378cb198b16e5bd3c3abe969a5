This plugin fixes that. Example output:\n\n> ERROR in ./src/containers/SearchProducts.js\n  Module not found: Error: [CaseSensitivePathsPlugin] `/Users/example/yourproject/src/components/searchProducts/searchproducts.js` does not match the corresponding path on disk `/Users/example/yourproject/src/components/searchproducts`\n   @ ./src/containers/SearchProducts.js 9:22-84\n\nInstall\n----\n    npm install --save-dev case-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin\n\nUsage\n----\n\n```JavaScript\nvar CaseSensitivePathsPlugin = require('case-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin');\n\nvar webpackConfig = {\n    plugins: [\n        new CaseSensitivePathsPlugin()\n        // other plugins ...\n    ]\n    // other webpack config ...\n}\n```\n\nWant more information? Pass ```{debug: true}``` to the plugin like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nnew CaseSensitivePathsPlugin({debug: true})\n```\n\nIt will output every directory it reads, as well as a sum total of filesystem operations.\nThis is mostly useful for internal debugging of the plugin, but if you find it useful, more power to you.\n\nDemo\n---\nCheck the `/demo` directory for a working example of the plugin in action, with tests demonstrating the effect of the plugin. See `/demo/README.md` for more.\n\nThanks & Credit\n----\n* [Daniel Cousineau](https://github.com/dcousineau) who wrote an [earlier
