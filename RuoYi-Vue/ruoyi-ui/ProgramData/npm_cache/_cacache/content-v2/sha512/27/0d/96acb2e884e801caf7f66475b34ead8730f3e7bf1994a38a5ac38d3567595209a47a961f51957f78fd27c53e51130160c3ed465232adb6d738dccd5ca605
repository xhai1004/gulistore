Even if an object doesn't have any circular references,\nthe tracking overhead is the cost. By default if an object with a circular\nreference is passed to `rfdc`, it will throw (similar to how `JSON.stringify` \\\nwould throw).\n\nUse the `circles` option to detect and preserve circular references in the\nobject. If performance is important, try removing the circular reference from\nthe object (set to `undefined`) and then add it back manually after cloning\ninstead of using this option.\n\n#### `constructorHandlers` option\n\nSometimes consumers may want to add custom clone behaviour for particular classes\n(for example `RegExp` or `ObjectId`, which aren't supported out-of-the-box).\n\nThis can be done by passing `constructorHandlers`, which takes an array of tuples,\nwhere the first item is the class to match, and the second item is a function that\ntakes the input and returns a cloned output:\n\n```js\nconst clone = require('rfdc')({\n  constructorHandlers: [\n    [RegExp, (o) => new RegExp(o)],\n  ]\n})\n\nclone({r: /foo/}) // => {r: /foo/}\n```\n\n**NOTE**: For performance reasons, the handlers will only match an instance of the\n*exact* class (not a subclass). Subclasses will need to be added separately if they\nalso need special clone behaviour.\n\n### `default` import\nIt is also possible to directly import the clone function with all options set\nto their default:\n\n```js\nconst clone = require(\"rfdc/default\")\nclone({a: 1, b: {c: 2}}) // => {a: 1, b: {c: 2}}\n```\n\n### Types\n\n`rfdc` clones all JSON types:\n\n* `Object`\n* `Array`\n* `Number`\n* `String`\n* `null`\n\nWith additional support for:\n\n* `Date` (copied)\n* `undefined` (copied)\n* `Buffer` (copied)\n* `TypedArray` (copied)\n* `Map` (copied)\n* `Set` (copied)\n* `Function` (referenced)\n* `AsyncFunction` (referenced)\n* `GeneratorFunction` (referenced)\n* `arguments` (copied to a normal object)\n\nAll other types have output values that match the output\nof `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o))`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```js\nconst rfdc = require('rfdc')()\nconst err = Error()\nerr.code = 1\nJSON.parse(JSON.stringify(e)) // {code: 1}\nrfdc(e) // {code: 1}\n\nJSON.parse(JSON.stringify({rx: /foo/})) // {rx: {}}\nrfdc({rx: /foo/}) // {rx: {}}\n```\n\n## Benchmarks\n\n```sh\nnpm run bench\n```\n\n```\nbenchDeepCopy*100: 671.675ms\nbenchLodashCloneDeep*100: 1.574s\nbenchCloneDeep*100: 936.792ms\nbenchFastCopy*100: 822.668ms\nbenchFastestJsonCopy*100: 363.898ms // See note below\nbenchPlainObjectClone*100: 556.635ms\nbenchNanoCopy*100: 770.234ms\nbenchRamdaClone*100: 2.695s\nbenchJsonParseJsonStringify*100: 2.290s // JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))\nbenchRfdc*100: 412.818ms\nbenchRfdcProto*100: 424.076ms\nbenchRfdcCircles*100: 443.357ms\nbenchRfdcCirclesProto*100: 465.053ms\n```\n\nIt is true that [fastest-json-copy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastest-json-copy) may be faster, BUT it has such huge limitations that it is rarely useful. For example, it treats things like `Date` and `Map` instances the same as empty `{}`. It can't handle circular references. [plain-object-clone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plain-object-clone) is also really limited in capability.\n\n## Tests\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\n```\n169 passing (342.514ms)\n```\n\n### Coverage\n\n```sh\nnpm run cov\n```\n\n```\n----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|\nFile      |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |\n----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|\nAll files |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                   |\n index.js |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                   |\n----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|\n```\n\n### `__proto__` own property copying\n\n`rfdc` works the same way as `Object.assign` when it comes to copying `['__proto__']` (e.g. when\nan object has an own property key called '__proto__'). It results in the target object \nprototype object being set per the value of the `['__proto__']` own property.\n\nFor detailed write-up on how a way to handle this security-wise see
